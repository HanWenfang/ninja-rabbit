==========

A very simple desktop, 2D platform game built in **JAVA** with _libGDX_ simply to demonstrate the use of various technologies and design patterns as I was learning them. This is, by no means, a complete video game and it puts no effort into being one. 

----------


#### Technologies
This project was developed using the following frameworks and tools:

 - [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) - A great **JAVA** game development framework.
 - [Box2D](http://box2d.org/) - Physics engine. _libGDX_ has a built-in **JAVA** implementation of it.
 - [libgdx-utils](https://bitbucket.org/dermetfan/libgdx-utils/wiki/Home) - A set of utility classes and methods that alleviates common work while using _libGDX_. Written by the renowned @dermetfan.
 - [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org) - Free tile map editor. Used as a level editor, as well as laying out physics related objects.

> All of the above are free and open source projects. You might as well considered donating or contributing something back if they have managed to help you in some way or if you enjoy using them.

#### Design
Ideas for the architecture and design were shamelessly taken from the phenomenal [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com) online book, by _EA_ developer [@munificentbob](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=munificentbob), following the path of [Erich Gamma](http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Gamma) and cia. Honorable mentions go to the [Component](http://) and [State](http://) design patterns. Both of them were used in **ninja-rabbit**.

> **Game Programming Patterns** is a must read. If you think of yourself a game developer or enthusiast, you owe to yourself reading it.

Also worth mentioning, is the handy work of [ForeignGuyMike](http://neetlife2.blogspot.com.ar/) who created the [LibGDX Box2D Tiled video tutorial series](http://youtu.be/85A1w1iD2oA?list=PL-2t7SM0vDfdYJ5Pq9vxeivblbZuFvGJK). Great for starting out with Box2D and drawing sprites.

#### Controls


* You move the rabbit character around by using the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys. Self explanatory.
* If you fall down a pit, you'll immediately respawn at the start of the level. There's no way to die.
